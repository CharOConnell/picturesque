                <p>Here we want your home or office to show off your artistic grandure and so we have a wonderful collection of photographs you can order as prints to delightfully decorate your space.
                I have been fortunate enough to have travelled to some amazing places and wanted to bring you all a little bit of these beautiful places from my photographs.</p>
                <p>The collection has photographs from America (The Grand Tetons, Yellowstone National Park, Colorado, Wyoming, Oregon, and maybe a few other states), Portugal (Faro, Portimão, Alvor), France (all around Brittany, Paris), Spain (Mojácar, Carboneras), England (Dartmoor, the Pennines, the Lake District) and Scotland.</p>
                <p>All our photographs are printed onto aluminium base plates which can be fitted using magentic stickers which we send to you that do not mark or scuff walls!
                Worried about shiny? All our products have a slight sheen, but if you desire a very shiny print or the most matt version we have, just pop us an e-mail from our <a class="text-white" href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact page</a> and we can sort it all out for you. <small>(N.B. there may be additional costs involved)</small></p>

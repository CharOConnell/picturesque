## Project purpose
Picturesque is an e-commerce website built to sell prints of photographs displayed on the site.
The prints can be chosen to be in an array of sizes with prices which reflect the change of size.
The photographs showcased are from my personal holiday collection.

There is a landing page which tells the user more about the inspiration and photography side of the website.
There is a gallery of different collections as the photographs are subdivided into categories.
The user is able to look at a specific photograph in more details before choosing which size to purchase.
There is a user profile page where the user is able to view their order history and can update their saved details.
Finally, there is a contact page where there are FAQs about the products and a contact form for the users to contact the site owner directly.
